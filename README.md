# Working with api dictionary

Api dictionary https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/ is a free api service , which gives us info about any word. If a word exists then it gives 200 response and gives json data containg definitions of the word, synonyms, antonyms and others and if the word does not exists the it gives back 404 response.

So, this python code accepts a word and shows the relevant info regarding that word.
